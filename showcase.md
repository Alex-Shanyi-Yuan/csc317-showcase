# Showcase Extra Credit (1-5%)
**Due Date: December 5th 11:55pm (10 Grace Tokens Applicable)**

As we wrap up the computer graphics course, you have the opportunity to produce any creative graphical Piece of anything you desire for between 1-5% extra credit on your total grade.  Specifically, your rendered Piece should adhere to the following criteria:
- Your Piece should be the **output from any of the 8 assignments in the course**.  You may update this code however you'd like and use any external C++ libraries or technologies.
- Your code should include significant features or updates that produces a cool result.  Some examples could be: adding new ray-tracing features, using more complex meshes from online, animating characters in new ways, custom texture mapping.
- All external assets (such as textures or models) you find online to use in your Piece **must be cited**.

## Deliverables:
Your deliverable should be submitted on MarkUs as either a **compressed file** or a **Github repository link** with the following:
- **Code/**: Source code that is compilable and executable to reproduce your rendered Piece.
- **Piece**: Rendered output file from the augmented assignment code, either an image or video file:
  - You shall name this file "piece" (*piece.png, piece.jpg, piece.mp4, piece.mov, etc*).
  - For images, please include the Name of your Piece, Full Name, "CSC317 Fall 2025" **as an overlay** in the corner of your image.
  - For videos, please include a **Title Screen** (roughly 2-3 seconds) with the Name of your Piece, Full Name, and "CSC317 Fall 2025" followed by your video rendering.
- **Writing**: Readme(.txt|.md|.pdf) with the following sections:
  - **Title**: Name of your Piece
  - **Personal Information**: Full Name, UtorID, student number, Assignment number you augmented (A1, A3, A8)
  - **Instructions**: instructions on how to run your code.
  - **Description**:
    - Write about what you produced with an explicit list of features you added to your rendered Piece and where in the code this is being applied.
  - **Acknowledgements**: Citations to all assets, libraries, or external materials you used in the Piece.
- **(Optional) Compilation Verification**: If you are worried whether your code will compile on our machines, you may submit a screen recording video or output log of your compilation process working on your machine.

## Grading:
All submissions will be given a minimum of 1% for non-trivial effort and further graded subjectively by the instructional team based on creativity and technicality.  Each grader will assign submissions with between 1-5%.  You showcase grade will be given some average of the team's votes.
- Any inappropriate Pieces will be given no credit.
- Any submission missing the required Code, Piece, or Writing will not be given any credit.

## Showcasing:
All Pieces will be uploaded to a public course webpage during finals weeks showcasing all student work.  We will also highlight a couple of staff picks. (Link tbd)
